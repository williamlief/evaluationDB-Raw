\f0\fs24 \cf0 I am a doctoral candidate at Stanford University and am researching teacher evaluation systems. I am particularly interested in understanding the variability in teacher evaluation reports across districts and time. \
\
I would like to request a district level count of teachers receiving each evaluation score for all Idaho school districts from the 2014-15 school year through the latest available records. As a reference, I have attached an example file with the desired layout - to be clear, the example file only shows one district but I would like to request records for all Idaho school districts. I would also like to emphasize that I am not seeking the ratings of individual teachers and am not interested in any PII, I am only requesting the district-year counts of teachers receiving each rating.\
\
Thank you for your time and assistance,\
