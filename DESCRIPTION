Description: This project is a compilation of publicly available teacher 
  evaluation reports for US school districts. In this repository you won't
  find teacher names and evalauation scores, but you will find the count of 
  teachers receiving each rating in a district. Run vignettes("overview") to see
  summary statistics for the data.
  It is not at all clear that evaluation reports are comparable across districts
  or states, and we urge extreme caution in attempting to directly compare 
  results across districts to identify 'good' or 'bad' districts. Districts with
  more teachers rated 'ineffective' may have worse teachers or they may simply 
  have been engaging with the evaluation tools in a different manner. 
  Detailed notes with the all raw data and sources are part of the github 
  repostiory (https://github.com/williamlief/evaluationDB), as is all code used 
  to clean and process the data.
