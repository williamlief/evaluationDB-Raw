## Teacher Evaluation Database Raw Data

This is the original raw data as downloaded from state websites or received via FOIA request. This repo was created to keep the evaluationDB package lightweight and easy to download. 

Use the function `raw_data_import()` from the evaluationDB package to download this data smoothly. 

## About this repo 

There is one folder for each state. Within the state folder is a folder called `evaluation` which holds the evaluation data and other supporting documentation.
